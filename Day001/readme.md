#About This Repository
Handmade Hero is an ongoing project to create a complete, professional-quality game accompanied by videos that explain every single line of its source code.

Many people have problems compiling the HandMade Hero Tutorials in Visual Studio Community 2015, so im creating a repository to work with just that. 
						
The source code is also extra commented to clarify what's happening. Personally I prefer the variable name conventions based on MSDN instead of the altered ones Casey uses in the original examples.

In addition, the formatting of the source code differences according to my own style.

#For Questions
For questions about this please use Github:

Do not ask Casey Muratori questions about this source code, as he is busy enough with this project.
