VS_HandMade
============
This repository for [Handmade Hero](http://handmadehero.org/) is created to compile under [Visual Studio Community 2015] (https://www.visualstudio.com/).

Many people have problems compiling the HandMade Hero Tutorials in Visual Studio Community 2015, so im creating a repository to work with just that. 
						
The source code is also extra commented to clarify what's happening. Personally I prefer the variable name conventions based on MSDN instead of the altered ones Casey uses in the original examples.

In addition, the formatting of the source code differences according to my own style.
